    <h2>About Me</h2>
     <div class="container">
    <p>Hi, I'm McDavis Albertio, originally from Ghana and now based in Spain. My journey here began with a passion for growth and new opportunities. I have a background in Administration and Management, but my curiosity for technology led me to transition into software engineering and web development. Currently, I'm deepening my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as I work toward becoming a software engineer. My goal is to combine my business knowledge with technology to create innovative financial solutions and impactful digital experiences.</p>

        <p>Having worked in administration and finance, I’ve learned a lot about how businesses operate, 
           how they function, and why financial management can be such a huge problem for them. 
           This experience piqued my interest in how technology can deliver creative solutions to these issues, 
           and I’m currently working to implement this knowledge in the tech sector.</p>
        <p>I am currently advancing my career in web development and software engineering with the goal of creating 
           technologically driven solutions to real-world problems, especially in the financial industry. 
           In addition to solving difficult problems and improving business operations, I love applying my skills 
           to learn new things and collaborate with like-minded individuals.</p>

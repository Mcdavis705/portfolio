        <h6>Posted on the 17th Feb. 2025</h6>
        
        <p>My name is Mcdavis Albertio, and I hold an HND in Administration and Finance, which I completed last year. However, after gaining practical experience in the field, I realized that it was not the right fit for me. While working in this domain, I often felt that I wanted to engage in more problem-solving tasks rather than solely performing administrative functions.
        <br><br>
        This realization led me to explore programming. I saw the potential to integrate programming with my background in Finance and Administration to develop solutions for financial challenges and automate repetitive tasks using modern technologies. With this in mind, I decided to embark on a journey to learn programming.
        <br><br>
        I began with Python, completing a foundational course on Coursera to grasp the basics. Recognizing the need for a more structured and immersive learning experience, I then set my sights on joining a coding boot camp to build a strong foundation in software development. Alongside Python, I committed to expanding my skills by delving into full-stack development. Currently, I am studying CSS and HTML through Khan Academy in preparation for admission into an advanced boot camp, which I plan to start in the coming weeks.
        <br><br>
        My learning path includes progressing to JavaScript next, ensuring that I am well-prepared for the intensive boot camp training ahead. My ultimate goal is to develop a solid technical foundation that will allow me to explore various aspects of the tech industry and leverage my programming skills to solve real-world financial and administrative problems.</p>

        <h6>Posted on the 21st Feb. 2025</h6>
        <p>At this stage of my learning journey, I am focusing on strengthening my foundational web development skills. This week, I have dedicated several days off from work to refine my understanding of HTML and CSS. I am committing approximately four hours per day to hands-on practice, ensuring that I fully grasp the fundamental concepts.
        <br><br>
        My goal is to build a strong foundation in HTML and CSS before transitioning to JavaScript. By mastering these core technologies now, I aim to minimize the need for revisiting the basics later, allowing for a smoother learning experience as I progress. This structured approach ensures that I am well-prepared for the next phase of my programming journey.
        <br><br>
        Further updates on my progress and learning strategies will follow as I continue refining my skills and advancing towards my goals.</p>

        <h6>Posted on the 23rd Feb. 2025</h6>

        <p>As I move forward, my focus is on applying the skills I have gained to demonstrate my readiness for the next stage of my learning journey. While awaiting admission into an advanced boot camp, I plan to consolidate my knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript by building a fully functional webpage. This project will serve as both a practical application of my learning and a portfolio piece to showcase my capabilities.

        <br><br>
        My goal is to present this webpage to the institution as evidence of my progress, demonstrating my commitment and technical proficiency. By taking this approach, I aim to strengthen my candidacy for admission and ensure that I enter the program with a solid foundation, ready to take on more advanced challenges in programming.</p>
